This app was primarily built to understand the concepts of routing in React and the use of React-router-DOM to setup multi page websites.
Currently the website uses data from a fake server setup using MirageJS. 

TBD: 
1. Styling fixes
2. Setting up a DB for importing van data
3. Allowing users to signup and add their credentials to the DB
